tacticBot

tacticBot moves first (P1): 

    - _makemove(RNG - middle or any corner).  
        - if P2 takes middle, makeMove(diagonally opposite opening move)
            - then proceed to _winBlockRNG(). 
        Should result in a tie. 

        - if P2 takes diagonally opposite corner, proceed to _winBlockRNG().  
        Should result in a tie.
        
        - if P2 takes an adj corner (i.e. first move was corner, and Opp takes corner that is not diagonally opposite from opening move), proceed to _winBlockRNG(). 
        Should result in P1 win. 

        - if P2 takes a crux GS, proceed to _winBlockRNG().  
        Should result in P1 win.
        

tacticBot moves second (P2):
    
    - if P1 first move = middle 
        - proceed to _winBlockRNG().  Should result in a tie.

    - if P1 first move = any corner
        - makeMove(diagonally opposite)
            - proceed to winBlockRNG();  Should result in a tie.
    
    - if P1 first move = crux
        - proceed to _winBlockRNG().  Should result in a tie.


_____________________________
_winBlockRNG()
- assess each available square to check if move will result in a win condition.  
    - if yes _makeMove() to win
    - if no, check for potential lose condition on next move
        - if yes _makeMove() to block
        - if no, is middle available?
            - if yes, _makeMove() middle
            - if no, are any corners available not adjacent to an opponent square?
                - if yes_makeMove()   
                - if no, does tTB have the middle and are any crux GS available opposite available squares
                    -if yes makeMove
                    - if no RNG any available square.
