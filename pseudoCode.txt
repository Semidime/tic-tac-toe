tacticBot

tacticBot moves first (P1): 

    A: CORNER OPENING
        - _makemove(RNG - any corner).  
            - if P2 takes middle, makeMove(diagonally opposite opening move)
                - proceed to _winBlockRNG(). Should result in a tie. 
            - if P2 takes diagonally opposite corner, proceed to _winBlockRNG().  Should result in a tie.
            - if P2 takes an adj corner (i.e. not diagonally opposite from opening move). _makeMove(nonMC adj to opening move, but not adjacent to P2's move).  
                - proceed to _winBlockRNG(). Should result in P1 win. 
            - if P2 takes a nonMC, proceed to _winBlockRNG().  Should result in P1 win.
        

    B: MIDDLE OPENING
        - proceed to _winBlockRNG().  Should result in a tie. 


    C: NMC OPENING
        - _makeMOve(RNG - any nonMC)
            - proceed to _winBlockRNG().  Should result in a tie.

tacticBot moves second (P2):
    
    - if P1 first move = middle 
        - proceed to _winBlockRNG().  Should result in a tie.

    - if P1 first move = any corner
        i.  80% of the time.  makeMove(diagonally opposite)
            - proceed to winBlockRNG();  Should result in a tie.
        ii. 20% of the time. makeMove(middle);
            - if P1 next move is diagonally opposite P1's first move, _makeMove(RNG - nonMC)
                - proceed to _winBlockRNG(). Should result in a tie.
            - else, proceed to _winBlockRNG().  Should result in a tie. 
    
    - if P1 first move = nonMC
        - proceed to _winBlockRNG().  Should result in a tie.


_____________________________
_winBlockRNG()
- assess each available square to check if move will result in a win condition.  
    - if yes _makeMove() to win
    - if no, check for potential lose condition on next move
        - if yes _makeMove() to block
        - if no, is middle available?
            - if yes, _makeMove() middle
            - if no, are any corners available?
                - if yes_makeMove()
                    - i. RNG any corner not adjacent to an opponent square
                    - ii. RNG any other corner
                - if no, makeMove(RNG any available nonMC).
